# SQL Data Analysis Project

I built a small relational dataset (customers, products, orders, order_items) and wrote queries to pull real insights like revenue, top products, monthly trends, and regional performance. I used JOINs, GROUP BY, and basic date grouping.

**Contents**
- `schema_and_data.sql` — schema and insert statements
- `queries.sql` — queries for typical business questions
- `analysis_results.md` — my takeaways
- `erd.png` — quick ERD
